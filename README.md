# codenames_generator
To aid with playing Codenames remotely, here's a clue card random generator.
There are 100 cards already made in the sample_clue_cards: just have the two clue
givers agree (in private) on which card they are referencing, and you're good to go!

If you want to make your own cards, the code is provide as both a notebook and
a script. Have at it and have fun!
